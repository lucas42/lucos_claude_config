# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) for all projects in this environment.

## Lucos Infrastructure Reference

A reference for AI agents working on any lucos project. Covers deployment infrastructure, CI/CD, and conventions.

---

## Environment Variables & lucos_creds

Secrets and environment-varying config are managed by a service called **lucos_creds**. To write the local development `.env` file, run:

```bash
scp -P 2202 "creds.l42.eu:${PWD##*/}/development/.env" .
```

This is aliased as `localcreds` in the user's shell, but that alias is not available to Claude — use the raw command above.

### Standard vars always provided by lucos_creds

Every project gets these automatically:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `SYSTEM` | The system name (e.g. `lucos_photos`) |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `development` or `production` |
| `PORT` | The port this service is exposed on |
| `APP_ORIGIN` | The public-facing base URL |

### Variable naming conventions

- External event infrastructure: `LOGANNE_ENDPOINT` (not `LUCOS_LOGANNE_URL` or similar)
- Authentication domain: always hardcode `https://auth.l42.eu` — do not use an env var for this
- Contacts API: `LUCOS_CONTACTS_URL`

### What goes where

- **Hardcode in `docker-compose.yml`**: non-sensitive values that never vary between environments (internal service URLs, fixed usernames, database names)
- **lucos_creds (`.env`)**: sensitive values and anything that varies between dev and production

Avoid constructing compound values (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`) in docker-compose using variable interpolation — the CI build step only has access to a dummy `PORT` and will fail if other variables are referenced. Instead, construct them in application code at startup (e.g. SQLAlchemy's `URL.create()`).

---

## Docker & Docker Compose

### Container naming

- `container_name` must be set on every container
- Names must follow the pattern `lucos_<project>_<role>` (e.g. `lucos_photos_api`, `lucos_photos_postgres`)

### Image naming (built containers only)

- Set `image:` on any container built from a Dockerfile
- Pattern: `lucas42/lucos_<project>_<role>` (e.g. `lucas42/lucos_photos_api`)

### Environment variables in compose

**Do not use `env_file`** — it breaks the CI build step.

Instead, declare every environment variable explicitly in the `environment` section using **array syntax**. This makes it clear which containers use which variables, and allows pass-through vars (sourced from the host environment / `.env` file) without specifying their values:

```yaml
environment:
  - SYSTEM                          # pass-through from host env
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD               # pass-through from host env
  - POSTGRES_USER=photos            # hardcoded value
  - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379    # hardcoded value
```

Dictionary syntax cannot express pass-through vars without a value, so always use array syntax in `environment`.

Note: Docker Compose still reads `.env` for **compose-level** variable substitution (e.g. `${PORT}` in `ports:`) even without `env_file` — this is a separate mechanism and is fine to use.

### Build context

When multiple services share code (e.g. a shared Python package), set the build context to the repo root and specify the Dockerfile path explicitly:

```yaml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: api/Dockerfile
```

The Dockerfile can then `COPY shared/ /shared/` from the repo root.

### Volumes

Always declare every volume explicitly — both in the service's `volumes:` mount and in the top-level `volumes:` section. Never rely on anonymous volumes created implicitly by a Docker image's `VOLUME` directive.

Anonymous volumes don't receive Docker Compose project labels, which breaks `lucos_backups` monitoring.

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data        # explicit mount — never omit this

volumes:
  redis_data:                   # always declare at top level
```

Every named volume must also be added to **`lucos_configy/config/volumes.yaml`** with a description and `recreate_effort`. Docker Compose names volumes as `<project>_<volume_name>` (e.g. `lucos_photos_redis_data`). Valid `recreate_effort` values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `automatic` | Can be fully regenerated automatically |
| `small` | Small technical effort to recreate |
| `tolerable` | Loss would be tolerable |
| `considerable` | Considerable effort to recreate |
| `huge` | Huge effort / primary source data |
| `remote` | Remote mount from elsewhere — set `skip_backup: true` |

### Networking

- HTTP traffic is proxied through a shared Nginx reverse proxy; TLS is terminated externally
- Services are exposed on `${PORT}`, configured per-environment via lucos_creds
- Containers on the same Docker Compose network communicate via service name as hostname

---

## CircleCI

When a project has no tests, the standard `.circleci/config.yml` is:

```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  lucos: lucos/deploy@0
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-deploy:
    jobs:
      - lucos/build-amd64
      - lucos/deploy-avalon:
          serial-group: << pipeline.project.slug >>/deploy-avalon
          requires:
            - lucos/build-amd64
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - main
```

When a project has tests, add a `test` job running **in parallel** with `build-amd64`; both must pass before deploy. Tests run on all branches (no filter), deploy only on `main`.

**Self-contained tests** (e.g. FastAPI + SQLite in-memory — no real DB or env file needed):

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.14
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: pip install -e shared/ -r api/requirements.txt -r api/requirements-test.txt
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: cd api && pytest
workflows:
  version: 2
  build-deploy:
    jobs:
      - test
      - lucos/build-amd64
      - lucos/deploy-avalon:
          serial-group: << pipeline.project.slug >>/deploy-avalon
          requires:
            - test
            - lucos/build-amd64
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - main
```

**Tests needing a real database** (e.g. Django — see lucos_contacts for full example): use `cimg/base:current` + `setup_remote_docker`, fetch a test `.env` from `creds.l42.eu:<repo>/test/.env`, and run via `docker compose --profile test up test --build --exit-code-from test`.

- The `lucos/build-amd64` job builds and pushes Docker images
- The `lucos/deploy-avalon` job deploys to the server, but only on `main`
- The CI build step has access to a dummy `PORT` only — no other env vars are available during build

## GitHub Credentials for AI Agents

When interacting with GitHub (creating issues, posting comments, etc.), authenticate as the appropriate GitHub App rather than using personal credentials.

| Persona | GitHub App | Bot name |
|---|---|---|
| General / default | `lucos-agent` | `lucos-agent[bot]` |
| lucos-issue-manager | `lucos-issue-manager` | `lucos-issue-manager[bot]` |
| lucos-code-reviewer | `lucos-code-reviewer` | `lucOS Code Reviewer[bot]` |

### Setup

The `get-token` script lives in `~/sandboxes/lucos_agent/`. It requires a `.env` file in that directory (containing keys for all apps), pulled from lucos_creds:

```bash
scp -P 2202 "creds.l42.eu:lucos_agent/development/.env" ~/sandboxes/lucos_agent/
```

### Making GitHub API calls

Use the `gh-as-agent` wrapper script instead of calling `gh api` directly. It handles token generation internally:

When the request body contains text (e.g. issue bodies, comments), write the payload to a file first and pass it via `--input`. This avoids backticks in Markdown content being misinterpreted as shell command substitution:

```bash
# Step 1: use the Write tool to create /tmp/gh-payload.json, e.g.:
# {"title": "Issue title", "body": "Body with `code` and **markdown**"}

# Step 2: call gh-as-agent with --input
# Default: authenticates as lucos-agent
~/sandboxes/lucos_agent/gh-as-agent repos/lucas42/{repo}/issues \
    --method POST \
    --input /tmp/gh-payload.json

# lucos-issue-manager persona: use --app as the first argument
~/sandboxes/lucos_agent/gh-as-agent --app lucos-issue-manager repos/lucas42/{repo}/issues \
    --method POST \
    --input /tmp/gh-payload.json

# lucos-code-reviewer persona
~/sandboxes/lucos_agent/gh-as-agent --app lucos-code-reviewer repos/lucas42/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/reviews \
    --method POST \
    --input /tmp/gh-payload.json
```

All `gh api` flags and arguments are passed through directly. There is no need to generate or manage tokens manually.

---

## Working on GitHub Issues

When assigned or asked to work on a GitHub issue, follow this workflow:

### 1. Post a starting comment

Before beginning any code changes, post a comment on the issue using `gh-as-agent` to say you're starting work and give a brief overview of your approach. Write it in the first person, e.g.:

> I'm going to tackle this by updating the API handler to validate the input before passing it to the database layer, then add a test to cover the new behaviour.

### 2. Create pull requests using gh-as-agent

Pull requests must be created using `gh-as-agent`, exactly like issue comments and any other GitHub API calls — **never** using `gh pr create` directly (which uses personal credentials instead of the correct bot identity). Write the PR body to a file and pass it via `--input`:

```bash
# Step 1: use the Write tool to create /tmp/gh-payload.json, e.g.:
# {"title": "Fix the thing", "head": "my-branch", "base": "main", "body": "Closes #42\n\n..."}

# Step 2: call gh-as-agent
~/sandboxes/lucos_agent/gh-as-agent repos/lucas42/{repo}/pulls \
    --method POST \
    --input /tmp/gh-payload.json
```

### 3. Tag commits and pull requests with the issue

Every commit and pull request made as part of the work should reference the issue number. In commit messages, include the issue reference (e.g. `Refs #42`). In the pull request body, use one of GitHub's standard closing keywords so the issue is automatically closed when the PR is merged into `main`:

```
Closes #42
```

The full list of supported keywords is: `close`, `closes`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved` — followed by the issue reference (e.g. `Fixes #42` or `Resolves lucas42/lucos_example#42`).

### 3. Comment on unexpected obstacles

If you hit a significant unexpected obstacle during the work — especially one that risks not being able to finish without further input — post a follow-up comment on the issue explaining what you've encountered. Don't silently get stuck or work around something without flagging it.

### 4. Don't close issues yourself

Issues should be closed automatically via the closing keyword in the merged PR. Do not close issues manually unless explicitly instructed to (e.g. told that an issue is now obsolete).

---

## GitHub Config

### CodeQL (`.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`)

Only include languages actually present in the repo. Remove any languages copied from another project that don't apply (e.g. `javascript` in a Python-only project).

### Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

Specify the correct directories for each ecosystem — these must match where the actual files live, not convention from the source project:

- `pip`: one entry per `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` location (e.g. `/api`, `/worker`, `/shared`)
- `docker`: one entry per `Dockerfile` location (e.g. `/api`, `/worker`)
- `github-actions`: always `directory: "/"`

Remove any `ignore` rules that were specific to the source project's framework (e.g. Django's `asgiref`).

### Dependabot auto-merge (`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`)

Standard file, no project-specific changes needed.

## The `/_info` Endpoint

Every lucos HTTP service must expose a `/_info` endpoint with no authentication. It is used by monitoring and a homepage app.

Response is JSON with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `system` | string | The system name — read from `SYSTEM` env var |
| `checks` | object | Live health checks (evaluated at request time). Each key is a check name; value has `ok` (bool) and `techDetail` (string) |
| `metrics` | object | Live metrics (evaluated at request time). Each key is a metric name; value has `value` (number) and `techDetail` (string) |
| `ci` | object | CI info: `{"circle": "gh/lucas42/<repo_name>"}` |
| `icon` | string | Path to the service's icon endpoint |
| `network_only` | bool | `true` if the UI requires a network connection to render; `false` if it works offline (e.g. via service workers) |
| `title` | string | Human-readable service name |
| `show_on_homepage` | bool | Whether to show this service on the lucos homepage |
| `start_url` | string | URL path to the UI entry point |

`checks` and `metrics` can be empty objects if there is nothing meaningful to report yet.

Example:

```json
{
  "system": "lucos_example",
  "checks": {
    "db-reachable": {
      "ok": true,
      "techDetail": "Checks whether a connection to PostgreSQL can be established"
    }
  },
  "metrics": {
    "photo-count": {
      "value": 42318,
      "techDetail": "Total number of photos stored"
    }
  },
  "ci": {
    "circle": "gh/lucas42/lucos_example"
  },
  "icon": "/icon",
  "network_only": true,
  "title": "Example",
  "show_on_homepage": true,
  "start_url": "/"
}
```
